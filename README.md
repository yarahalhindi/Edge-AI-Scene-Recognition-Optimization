## The Goal
The primary objective of this project is to build a Deep Learning system capable of accurately **detecting and classifying** objects within a university campus environment.

The challenge wasn't just to identify a "Car" or a "Tree," but to distinguish between visually similar structures—specifically **"Labs" vs. "Buildings"**—which often confuse standard models. We wanted to see if we could achieve high accuracy not just on heavy servers, but also on lightweight architectures suitable for future mobile applications.

## The Data
We created our own dataset from scratch to ensure the models were tested on real-world data, not just perfect internet images.
* **Source:** Manually captured images around the University of Jordan.
* **Classes:** 5 Categories (Building, Car, Lab, Person, Tree).
* **Processing:** Images were manually filtered, resized to 224x224, and augmented (Rotation, Flip, Zoom) to increase dataset diversity.

## The Engineering Breakthrough
Our research led to a critical discovery when testing different "Attention Mechanisms" to improve the classification:

1.  **The Heavyweight Test (DenseNet):** When we added **CBAM** (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to the large DenseNet model, it worked perfectly, achieving **99.15%** accuracy.
2.  **The Lightweight Test (EfficientNet):** When we tried the exact same CBAM technique on the smaller EfficientNet, the performance actually **dropped**. It was too aggressive for the smaller network.
3.  **The Solution:** We switched to **Coordinate Attention (CA)** for the lightweight models. This improved the model's ability to focus on specific features without losing information, boosting accuracy to **98.03%**.

## 📊 Performance Benchmark

| Category | Architecture | Attention Strategy | Accuracy | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server** | **DenseNet121** | **CBAM** | **99.15%** | 🏆 **Overall Best Accuracy** |
| **Edge** | **EfficientNet-B0** | **Coordinate Att.** | **98.03%** | ⚡ **Best Efficiency** |
| **Edge** | **MobileNetV2** | **Coordinate Att.** | **High** | ✅ **Outperformed MobileNetV3** |
| Edge | MobileNetV3 | Built-in SE | Lower | Lost to V2 + CA |
| Edge | EfficientNet-B0 | CBAM | 95.77% | ❌ Performance Drop |
| Baseline | MobileNetV2 | None | 92.40% | Baseline (Too Low) |

> **Key Finding:** By manually adding Coordinate Attention to the older **MobileNetV2**, we achieved higher accuracy than the newer, pre-optimized **MobileNetV3**, proving the effectiveness of our custom attention strategy.
